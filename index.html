            A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site that 
            fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a user experience 
            similar to that of a desktop application. In an SPA, either all necessary 
            code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is retrieved with a single page load, 
            or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as 
            necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at 
            any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although 
            the location hash or the HTML5 History API can be used to provide the perception 
            and navigability of separate logical pages in the application. Interaction with 
            the single page application often involves dynamic communication with the web 
            server behind the scenes.

          <p>
            Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework for 
            designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and 
            CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation 
            and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. 
            Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only.
            Bootstrap is the second most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 
            107,000 stars and 48,000 forks.
            Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and 
            Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal 
            tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which 
            led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden.
            After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter 
            began to contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week 
            for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap, 
            and released as an open source project on August 19, 2011. It has continued to 
            be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, and a small group of core developers, 
            as well as a large community of contributors.

                </div>
                <p class="less">
                  The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built with CSS 3D transforms 
                  and a bit of JavaScript. It works with a series of images, text, or custom markup. It also includes 
                  support for previous/next controls and indicators.
                </p>
                <button class="more-btn" id="carousel-more-btn" type="button">More...</button>

                <div class="more col-md-9">
                  <p>
                    In browsers where the Page Visibility API is supported, the carousel will avoid sliding when the 
                    webpage is not visible to the user (such as when the browser tab is inactive, the browser window is 
                    minimized, etc.).Please be aware that nested carousels are not supported, and carousels are 
                    generally not compliant with accessibility standards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Carousels don’t automatically normalize slide dimensions. As such, you may need to use additional 
                    utilities or custom styles to appropriately size content. While carousels support previous/next controls 
                    and indicators, they’re not explicitly required. Add and customize as you see fit. Be sure to set a unique 
                    id on the .carousel for optional controls, especially if you’re using multiple carousels on a single page.

                  The navbar is a wrapper that positions branding, navigation, and other elements in a concise header.
                  It’s easily extensible and, thanks to our Collapse plugin, can easily integrate responsive behaviors.

                  <h2>How it works</h2>
                  <p>Here’s what you need to know before getting started with the navbar:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Navbars require a wrapping .navbar with .navbar-toggleable-* for responsive collapsing and color scheme classes.</li>
                    <li>Navbars and their contents are fluid by default. Use optional containers to limit their horizontal width.</li>
                    <li>Navbars and their contents are built with flexbox, providing easy alignment options via utility classes.</li>
                    <li>Navbars are responsive by default, but you can easily modify them to change that. Responsive behavior depends on our Collapse JavaScript plugin.</li>
                    <li> 
                      Ensure accessibility by using a <nav> element or, if using a more generic element such as a <div>, add a role="navigation" to every navbar to explicitly 
                      identify it as a landmark region for users of assistive technologies.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 
                  columns as the device or viewport size increases. It includes predefined classes for easy layout 
                  options, as well as powerful mixins for generating more semantic layouts.

                    Bootstrap makes use of certain HTML elements and CSS properties that require the use of the HTML5 doctype. 
                    Include it at the beginning of all your projects.

                  <p>
                    With Bootstrap 2, we added optional mobile friendly styles for key aspects of the framework. With Bootstrap 3, 
                    we've rewritten the project to be mobile friendly from the start. Instead of adding on optional mobile styles, 
                    they're baked right into the core. In fact, Bootstrap is mobile first. Mobile first styles can be found 
                    throughout the entire library instead of in separate files.To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, 
                    add the viewport meta tag to your <head>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can disable zooming capabilities on mobile devices by adding user-scalable=no to the viewport meta tag. 
                    This disables zooming, meaning users are only able to scroll, and results in your site feeling a bit more 
                    like a native application. Overall, we don't recommend this on every site, so use caution!

          <p>
            jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to 
            simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.
            It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT 
            license.Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely 
            deployed JavaScript library by a large margin.
          </p>
          <p>
            jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate 
            a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle 
            events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides 
            capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the 
            JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions 
            for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, 
            themeable widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows 
            the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            The set of jQuery core features—DOM element selections, traversal and 
            manipulation—enabled by its selector engine (named "Sizzle" from v1.3), 
            created a new "programming style", fusing algorithms and DOM data structures. 
            This style influenced the architecture of other JavaScript frameworks like 
            YUI v3 and Dojo, later stimulating the creation of the standard Selectors API.
          </p>
          <p> 
            Microsoft and Nokia bundle jQuery on their platforms. Microsoft includes it with 
            Visual Studio for use within Microsoft's ASP.NET AJAX and ASP.NET MVC frameworks 
            while Nokia has integrated it into the Web Run-Time widget development platform.

            Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for developing 
            a diverse variety of server tools and applications. Although Node.js is not a JavaScript 
            framework, many of its basic modules are written in JavaScript, and developers can write 
            new modules in JavaScript. The runtime environment interprets JavaScript using Google's V8 JavaScript engine.                    p
            Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices 
            aim to optimize throughput and scalability in Web applications with many input/output operations, 
            as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).                    p
            The Node.js distributed development project, governed by the Node.js Foundation, is facilitated 
            by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.                    p
            Corporate users of Node.js software include GoDaddy, Groupon, IBM, LinkedIn, Microsoft,
            Netflix, PayPal, Rakuten, SAP, Voxer, Walmart, Yahoo!, and Cisco Systems.

            Node.js allows the creation of Web servers and networking tools using JavaScript and a 
            collection of "modules" that handle various core functionality. Modules are provided for 
            file system I/O, networking (DNS, HTTP, TCP, TLS/SSL, or UDP), binary data (buffers), 
            cryptography functions, data streams and other core functions. Node.js's modules use an 
            API designed to reduce the complexity of writing server applications. Node.js applications 
            can run on Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, NonStop, and Unix servers. They can alternatively 
            be written with CoffeeScript (a JavaScript alternative), Dart or Microsoft TypeScript 
            (strongly typed forms of JavaScript), or any other language that can compile to JavaScript. 
            Node.js is primarily used to build network programs such as Web servers. The biggest 
            difference between Node.js and PHP is that most functions in PHP block until completion 
            (commands execute only after previous commands have completed), while functions in Node.js 
            are designed to be non-blocking (commands execute in parallel, and use callbacks to signal 
            completion or failure)

                    NPM is automatically included when Node.js is installed. NPM consists of a command 
                    line client that interacts with a remote registry. It allows users to consume and 
                    distribute JavaScript modules that are available on the registry. Packages on the 
                    registry are in CommonJS format and include a metadata file in JSON format. Over 
                    280,000 packages are available on the main NPM registry. The registry has no vetting 
                    process for submission, which means that packages found there can be low quality, 
                    insecure, or malicious. However, the NPM server administrators are fully capable of 
                    deleting malicious packages or banning malicious users.

                    NPM exposes usage statistics 
                    and number of depending packages to assist developers in picking libraries.Packages 
                    on NPM are registered on a first-come, first-served basis and do not distinguish among 
                    authors, meaning that the unpublishing of a package can not only break the projects 
                    that depend on it, but also pose a security risk. For example, a package named 
                    "left-pad" that only padded the left side of strings inadvertently caused many builds 
                    to fail when it was removed.

                  Grunt is a JavaScript task runner, a tool used to automatically perform frequently 
                  used tasks such as minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc. It uses 
                  a command-line interface to run custom tasks defined in a file (known as a Gruntfile)

                    Grunt was originally created by Ben Alman in 2012, as an efficient alternative to 
                    simply writing and maintaining a suite of JavaScript build process tasks in one huge 
                    file. It was designed as a task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects. 
                    Grunt is primarily used to automate tasks that need to be performed routinely. There are 
                    thousands of plugins that can be installed and used directly to perform some commonly used 
                    tasks. One of Grunt's most desirable features is that it is highly customizable i.e it 
                    allows developers to add, extend and modify custom tasks to fit their personal requirements. 
                    Each task has a set of configuration options that can be set by the user to meet their specific 
                    needs. Moreover, Grunt offers the ability to define custom tasks, which can combine multiple 
                    existing tasks into a single task or add entirely new functionality
