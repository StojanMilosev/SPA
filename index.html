          <p>
            A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site that 
            fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a user experience 
            similar to that of a desktop application. In an SPA, either all necessary 
            code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is retrieved with a single page load,[1] 
            or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as 
            necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at 
            any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although 
            the location hash or the HTML5 History API can be used to provide the perception 
            and navigability of separate logical pages in the application.[2] Interaction with 
            the single page application often involves dynamic communication with the web 
            server behind the scenes.

            Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework for 
            designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and 
            CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation 
            and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. 
            Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bootstrap is the second most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 
            107,000 stars and 48,000 forks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and 
            Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal 
            tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which 
            led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden.
            After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter 
            began to contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week 
            for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap, 
            and released as an open source project on August 19, 2011. It has continued to 
            be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, and a small group of core developers, 
            as well as a large community of contributors.

                </div>
                <p class="less">
                  The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built with CSS 3D transforms 
                  and a bit of JavaScript. It works with a series of images, text, or custom markup. It also includes 
                  support for previous/next controls and indicators.
                </p>
                <button class="more-btn" id="carousel-more-btn" type="button">More...</button>

                </div>
                <div class="more col-md-9">
                  <p>
                    In browsers where the Page Visibility API is supported, the carousel will avoid sliding when the 
                    webpage is not visible to the user (such as when the browser tab is inactive, the browser window is 
                    minimized, etc.).Please be aware that nested carousels are not supported, and carousels are 
                    generally not compliant with accessibility standards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Carousels don’t automatically normalize slide dimensions. As such, you may need to use additional 
                    utilities or custom styles to appropriately size content. While carousels support previous/next controls 
                    and indicators, they’re not explicitly required. Add and customize as you see fit. Be sure to set a unique 
                    id on the .carousel for optional controls, especially if you’re using multiple carousels on a single page.
                  </p>

                  The navbar is a wrapper that positions branding, navigation, and other elements in a concise header.
                  It’s easily extensible and, thanks to our Collapse plugin, can easily integrate responsive behaviors.

                  <h2>How it works</h2>
                  <p>Here’s what you need to know before getting started with the navbar:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Navbars require a wrapping .navbar with .navbar-toggleable-* for responsive collapsing and color scheme classes.</li>
                    <li>Navbars and their contents are fluid by default. Use optional containers to limit their horizontal width.</li>
                    <li>Navbars and their contents are built with flexbox, providing easy alignment options via utility classes.</li>
                    <li>Navbars are responsive by default, but you can easily modify them to change that. Responsive behavior depends on our Collapse JavaScript plugin.</li>
                    <li> 
                      Ensure accessibility by using a <nav> element or, if using a more generic element such as a <div>, add a role="navigation" to every navbar to explicitly 
                      identify it as a landmark region for users of assistive technologies.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 
                  columns as the device or viewport size increases. It includes predefined classes for easy layout 
                  options, as well as powerful mixins for generating more semantic layouts.

                    Bootstrap makes use of certain HTML elements and CSS properties that require the use of the HTML5 doctype. 
                    Include it at the beginning of all your projects.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With Bootstrap 2, we added optional mobile friendly styles for key aspects of the framework. With Bootstrap 3, 
                    we've rewritten the project to be mobile friendly from the start. Instead of adding on optional mobile styles, 
                    they're baked right into the core. In fact, Bootstrap is mobile first. Mobile first styles can be found 
                    throughout the entire library instead of in separate files.To ensure proper rendering and touch zooming, 
                    add the viewport meta tag to your <head>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can disable zooming capabilities on mobile devices by adding user-scalable=no to the viewport meta tag. 
                    This disables zooming, meaning users are only able to scroll, and results in your site feeling a bit more 
                    like a native application. Overall, we don't recommend this on every site, so use caution!

            jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to 
            simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.
            It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT 
            license.Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely 
            deployed JavaScript library by a large margin.
          </p>
          <p>
            jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate 
            a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle 
            events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides 
            capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the 
            JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions 
            for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, 
            themeable widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows 
            the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            The set of jQuery core features—DOM element selections, traversal and 
            manipulation—enabled by its selector engine (named "Sizzle" from v1.3), 
            created a new "programming style", fusing algorithms and DOM data structures. 
            This style influenced the architecture of other JavaScript frameworks like 
            YUI v3 and Dojo, later stimulating the creation of the standard Selectors API.

            Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for developing 
            a diverse variety of server tools and applications. Although Node.js is not a JavaScript 
            framework, many of its basic modules are written in JavaScript, and developers can write 
            new modules in JavaScript. The runtime environment interprets JavaScript using Google's V8 JavaScript engine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices 
            aim to optimize throughput and scalability in Web applications with many input/output operations, 
            as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).

            The Node.js distributed development project, governed by the Node.js Foundation, is facilitated 
            by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.
