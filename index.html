                A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site that 
                fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a user experience 
                similar to that of a desktop application. In an SPA, either all necessary 
                code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is retrieved with a single page load,[1] 
                or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as 
                necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at 
                any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although 
                the location hash or the HTML5 History API can be used to provide the perception 
                and navigability of separate logical pages in the application.[2] Interaction with 
                the single page application often involves dynamic communication with the web 
                server behind the scenes.

          </p>
          <p>
            Bootstrap is the second most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 
            107,000 stars and 48,000 forks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and 
            Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal 
            tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which 
            led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden.
            After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter 
            began to contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week 
            for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap, 
            and released as an open source project on August 19, 2011. It has continued to 
            be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton, and a small group of core developers, 
            as well as a large community of contributors.
          </p>
          <p>
            On January 31, 2012, Bootstrap 2 was released, which added a twelve-column responsive 
            grid layout system, inbuilt support for Glyphicons, several new components, as well as 
            changes to many of the existing components.
          </p>
          <p>
            On August 19, 2013, Bootstrap 3 was released, which redesigned components to 
            use flat design, and a mobile first approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            On October 29, 2014, Mark Otto announced that Bootstrap 4 was in development.
            The first alpha version of Bootstrap 4 was released on August 19, 2015.

            jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to 
            simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.
            It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT 
            license.Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely 
            deployed JavaScript library by a large margin.
          </p>
          <p>
            jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate 
            a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle 
            events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides 
            capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the 
            JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions 
            for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, 
            themeable widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows 
            the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            The set of jQuery core features—DOM element selections, traversal and 
            manipulation—enabled by its selector engine (named "Sizzle" from v1.3), 
            created a new "programming style", fusing algorithms and DOM data structures. 
            This style influenced the architecture of other JavaScript frameworks like 
            YUI v3 and Dojo, later stimulating the creation of the standard Selectors API.

            PHP is a server-side scripting language designed primarily 
            for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming 
            language. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, the PHP 
            reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Development 
            Team. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now 
            stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
          </p>
          <p>
            PHP code may be embedded into HTML or HTML5 code, or it can be 
            used in combination with various web template systems, web content 
            management systems and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed 
            by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module in the web server or as 
            a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. The web server combines 
            the results of the interpreted and executed PHP code, which may be 
            any type of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP 
            code may also be executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can 
            be used to implement standalone graphical applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free 
            software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported
            and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating 
            system and platform, free of charge.
          </p>
          <p>
            The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or 
            standard until 2014, leaving the canonical PHP interpreter as a de
            facto standard. Since 2014 work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.
